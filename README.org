#+TITLE: FZAM | Fuzzy AppImage Manager 
[[./screenshot.png]]

*WARNING: I am not responsible for any AppImage that is integrated to the system using fzam and it is malware.*

FZAM is a bash script that lets the user integrate their AppImages to their desktop environment easily. It uses [[https://github.com/junegunn/fzf][fzf]] as its interface.

When the user selects an AppImage, fzam extracts the .desktop file from the root of the AppImage, together with its icon (.DirIcon) and make the required changes to the .desktop
file to launch the AppImage and use its icon. 

By default the AppImage, its icon and its desktop entry are moved into predefined locations (*~/Applications*, *~/Applications/.icons* and *~/.local/share/applications* respectively), and those locations can be changed in the script by the user.

* Depedencies
- fzf
- xargs
- file (Some distributions include it by default but not every single one, for example Arch)
- tree (Same reason as above)

* Installation
Simply download the script from the repository, make the script executable (chmod +x fzam) and place it somewhere on your system. (For example ~/.local/bin)

* FAQ
** I cannot launch the AppImage through my desktop's menu.
Fzam changes the arguments in the Exec= line in the AppImage's .desktop file through pattern matching with sed. So a lot of times this line points to a file that does not exist.
To fix that simply open the .desktop file of the AppImage (the script places it in ~/.local/share/applications) with a text editor (or through the fzam menu) and change the Exec line to point to the AppImage location.

So for LibreOffice for example it would be:
#+begin_example
Change Exec=~/Applications/libreoffice.AppImage25.2 %U (invalid) to: Exec=~/Applications/libreoffice.AppImage %U
#+end_example

** Fzam uses a wrong name for AppImage.
Simply change the AppImage's filename and its icon filename to the one you want. After that change the .desktop file to point to the right icon and AppImage (in the Icon= and Exec= lines respectively).

* Features
- Integrate AppImages
- Delete AppImages
- List all installed AppImages

* Features that may or may not be added
- Updating. Not every single AppImage support it ([[https://github.com/AppImageCommunity/AppImageUpdate][AppImageUpdate]] is a solution to this.)
